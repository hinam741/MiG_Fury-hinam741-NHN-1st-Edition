## How to play

* Controls:
Press Left Ctrl to start the game and to shoot bullets. Use the arrow keys to move the plane. During the game, shoot enemy planes and avoid their bullets.

* Scoring:
When you shoot down an enemy, it may drop random PodPoints. Move your plane to collect them. Points are only awarded when you collect PodPoints, not when you shoot enemies.

* High Score System:
There is no win condition — the goal is to get a high score. If your score is higher than one of the top 8 in the Highscores list, it will be marked as "A New Record". You can then enter your name and press Enter to save it.

* Game Over:
The game ends if your plane gets hit by an enemy bullet.
